<h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Sricharan a passionate web developer with a growing expertise in HTML, CSS, and responsive design. I love turning clean code into beautiful, functional layouts that adapt seamlessly across devices. Whether I’m refining media queries or troubleshooting tricky styling issues, I approach every challenge with clarity, persistence, and a love for learning.

<p>Beyond the code, I’m a big fan of Indian cinema, always keeping up with the latest hits and timeless classics. I believe great design is like a great film visually compelling, emotionally resonant, and built with intention</p>


<p>Currently, I’m focused on building sleek, user-friendly websites and expanding my skills into modern frameworks and design tools. Let’s build something amazing together.
